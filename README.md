## Getting started

### Setup

Follow these steps for a development environment:

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system and have got the appropiate rights set. Then run the following command:

```
npm install
```

Now you have to create a `.env.local` file in your root folder.

This should contain the following properties:

```
DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"
EMAIL_FROM="changeme@yourdomain.com"
SMTP_USER="Insert SMTP Username"
SMTP_PASSWORD="Insert SMTP Password"
SMTP_PORT="Insert PORT to connect to the SMTP-Server, usually 587"
SMTP_HOST="Insert HOST_Name of SMTP-Server"
MODE="DEVELOPMENT"
```

When mode !== development mails will be sent!

### Running the Application

Running `npm run start` will startup a server which can be reached over the specified url :)

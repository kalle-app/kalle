## Pull Request template

Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that:

   a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

   b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

   c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

   d. Running tests doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

2. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

   a. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `master` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `develop` instead.

   b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

   c. Provide a description of your changes.

   d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.
